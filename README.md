## What It Is

Translator-AI is an AI-based translation system designed to help translate long texts (or documents) more reliably than a naive single-pass model. It incorporates iterative refinement, context tracking, and error correction to improve quality.

The goal is not just literal translation, but to maintain meaning, style, and coherence across paragraphs.

## Features

- Passes text through multiple translation + refinement cycles  
- Maintains context across paragraphs (to reduce meaning drift)  
- Support for documents / longer texts  
- Extensible architecture (you should be able to swap in new translation models or providers)  
- Logging & error detection (to identify issues and let you intervene)  

## Architecture / Components

Here's a high-level view of how it works:

1. **Input parsing / segmentation** — splits long text or document into manageable units (e.g. paragraphs)  
2. **Translation pass** — runs an AI translation (or model) on each unit  
3. **Refinement / self-correction pass** — compares output with previous passes, tries to fix errors or improve consistency  
4. **Context enforcement** — ensures translated segments align with neighboring parts, smooth transitions  
5. **Output re-assembly** — stitches back everything into a coherent document  

You'll find modules (in `apps/` or related directories) that implement each stage. A `docker-compose.yml` is provided so you can spin up the system with dependencies.

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (or whatever version you use)  
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt` (or equivalent)  
- (Optional) Access keys / credentials / API tokens for translation model(s)  
- Docker & Docker Compose (if you use the docker setup)  

## Installation

Here's how to get Translator-AI up and running locally:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Dhruvjindal-source/Translator-AI.git
cd Translator-AI

# If using Python virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) Build and run via Docker
docker-compose up --build
```

## Usage

Here's how you use it once installed:

1. Place your text or document input in a known directory (or pass via CLI)

2. Run the translation script / command. Example:

   ```bash
   python translate.py --input path/to/input.txt --output path/to/output.txt --source en --target hi
   ```

3. The system will process in passes, log status, and write the final translated output.

You can also pass flags for debugging, verbose logs, or limiting passes.

## Configuration

You may want to customize:

* **Number of refinement passes**
* **Which translation model/provider** (e.g. OpenAI, local model, etc.)
* **Context window size / lookahead / backtracking**
* **Logging settings / error thresholds**

These options are typically exposed via a config file (e.g. `config.yaml`) or command line flags.

## Examples

Assume you have a file `sample_en.txt`:

```
This is the first paragraph.
This is the second paragraph.
```

You run:

```bash
python translate.py --input sample_en.txt --output sample_hi.txt --source en --target hi
```

You should get a translated `sample_hi.txt` with consistent flow and corrections.

## Limitations & Caveats

* AI translation is never perfect. Always review output.
* Quality can degrade over very long documents or with highly technical content.
* Costs and latency may be high depending on model / provider used.
* The refinement logic is heuristic; corner cases may cause inconsistency.

## Roadmap / Future Work

* Support more file types (DOCX, PDF)
* Add user feedback / correction loop
* Add UI / web interface
* Better error detection & fallback
* Experiment with alternate translation models

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Here's how you can help:

* Report bugs or propose issues
* Add support for new translation backends
* Improve refinement algorithms
* Add tests & benchmarks
* Improve documentation

Please follow best practices: fork → branch → submit pull request, include tests & descriptive commit messages.
