## What It Is

Translator-AI is a real-time translation system designed for live meetings and conversations. It captures audio, transcribes speech, translates it on-the-fly, and delivers translated output with minimal latency. Perfect for multilingual teams, international conferences, or cross-border collaboration.

The goal is to break down language barriers in real-time communication, allowing participants to speak in their native language while others receive instant translations.

## Features

- **Real-time audio capture** — captures live conversation audio from meetings  
- **Speech-to-text transcription** — converts spoken words to text using AI  
- **Live translation** — translates transcribed text instantly to target language(s)  
- **Low latency processing** — optimized pipeline for near-instant translation  
- **Multi-participant support** — handles multiple speakers in a conversation  
- **Context awareness** — maintains conversation context for more accurate translations  
- **Interactive UI** — React-based interface for easy control and visualization  
- **Containerized deployment** — Docker support for consistent environments  

## Architecture / Components

Here's a high-level view of how it works:

1. **Audio Capture** — captures live audio from microphone/meeting platform  
2. **Speech Recognition** — transcribes audio to text in real-time using STT models  
3. **Language Detection** — identifies the source language automatically  
4. **Translation Engine** — translates transcribed text to target language(s)  
5. **Output Delivery** — displays/broadcasts translated text via React frontend  
6. **Context Management** — tracks conversation flow to improve translation accuracy  

The backend is built with **Node.js**, the frontend with **React**, and the entire system can be deployed using **Docker**.

## Requirements

- Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn  
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)  
- Microphone access for audio capture  
- API keys for translation services (OpenAI, Google Translate, etc.)  
- Stable internet connection for real-time processing  

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js
- **Frontend:** React
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Package Manager:** npm/yarn

## Installation

Here's how to get Translator-AI up and running locally:

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Dhruvjindal-source/Translator-AI.git
cd Translator-AI

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and configuration

# Run the application
npm start

# Or use Docker
docker-compose up --build
```

## Usage

Here's how to use Translator-AI for live meetings:

1. **Start the application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or with Docker:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

2. **Open the web interface** at `http://localhost:3000`

3. **Configure your settings:**
   - Select source and target language(s)
   - Choose audio input device
   - Set translation mode (meeting, conversation, presentation)

4. **Start translation:**
   - Click "Start" to begin capturing audio
   - The system automatically transcribes and translates in real-time
   - View translations in the React interface

5. **Stop translation** when meeting ends

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm start          # Start development server
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run dev        # Run in development mode
npm test           # Run tests
docker-compose up  # Run with Docker
```

## Configuration

Customize your setup via `.env` file or `config.json`:

* **Audio input device** — select which microphone to use
* **Translation model/provider** — OpenAI, Google, Azure, or other APIs
* **Latency vs. accuracy trade-off** — adjust buffer sizes and processing speed
* **Target languages** — set default translation languages
* **Display settings** — customize UI theme and layout
* **Speaker identification** — enable/disable multi-speaker detection
* **Port configuration** — change default ports for frontend/backend

## Examples

### Example 1: Bilingual Meeting

Set source language to English and target to Hindi. All English speech is automatically translated and displayed in the React interface.

### Example 2: International Conference

Enable auto-detect for source language and select multiple targets (Spanish, French, German). The UI shows all translations simultaneously.

### Example 3: One-on-One Conversation

Configure for conversation mode with English to Japanese translation. Real-time captions appear for both participants.

## Limitations & Caveats

* **Latency** — 1-3 second delay typical; exact timing depends on internet speed and model choice
* **Accuracy** — AI translation may miss nuances, idioms, or technical jargon
* **Audio quality** — Background noise and multiple overlapping speakers can reduce accuracy
* **Internet dependency** — Requires stable connection for cloud-based models
* **Privacy** — Audio data may be processed by third-party services; review their policies
* **Accent sensitivity** — Heavy accents or non-standard speech may affect transcription quality
* **Browser compatibility** — Best performance on Chrome/Edge; some features may vary on other browsers

## Roadmap / Future Work

* **Offline mode** — support for local models without internet dependency
* **Video meeting integrations** — direct plugins for Zoom, Teams, Google Meet
* **Improved speaker diarization** — better identification of who's speaking
* **Custom vocabulary** — allow users to add domain-specific terms
* **Mobile app** — iOS and Android versions for on-the-go translation
* **Live subtitle overlay** — display translations as captions over video feeds
* **Multi-language mixing** — handle conversations where multiple languages are used simultaneously
* **Recording & export** — save translated transcripts for later reference
* **WebRTC support** — peer-to-peer audio streaming for better performance
